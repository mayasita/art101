			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>Working with my partner, I experimented with Javascript arrays and objects to organize information about my methods of transportation.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Me and my partner had very little trouble completing this lab. We ran into some difficulty referencing elements of an object within the browser console, but were able to resolve this by using the same syntax as previous tasks.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results of this lab are what you are resting your eyes upon now, here in this very moment!</p>
