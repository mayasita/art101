			      <h2>Challenges</h2>
			      	<p>This lab tasked me and my partner with utilizing our past knowledge of functions and arrays to create a functioning button to sort the user's name.</p>
			      <h2>Problems</h2>
				      <p>I had a bit of a tough time figuring out the order and syntax of my Javascript file, as well as what to include and what to leave out. As an added challenge to this project, we decided to create additional buttons throughout our webpages.</p>
