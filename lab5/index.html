			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>For this Lab, me and my partner were tasked with declaring Javascript variables in the context of car makes and models, and translated this language into Atom.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We did not run into any significant problems, although I did find Javascript variables and formatting unfamiliar at first. However I found it easy to catch on once I started writing it.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Ultimately, this lab resulted in the html file you are looking at now. Plus I understand the function of Javascript now!</p>
