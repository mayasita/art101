			      <h2>Challenges</h2>
			      	<p>This lab required me and my partner to experiment with DOM manipulation, thus altering our HTML page through Javascript.</p>
			      <h2>Problems</h2>
				      <p>I personally had difficulty picking up the DOM rules and style of writing within Javascript. I also had a tough time debugging my Javascript file, and had to make many changes to come to a fuctioning document.</p>
			      <h2>Results</h2>
				      <p>The results of this lab are right here! Hello!</p>
