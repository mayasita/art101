        <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>For this lab, we were given the opportunity to debug and reupload past labs that were not functioning on our websites.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>Me and my partner decided to debug my Lab 11 page, because we were never able to figure out why my buttons weren't working. </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>The results of this lab are here!</p>
        <h2>Debugging</h2>
