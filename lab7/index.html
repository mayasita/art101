			      <h2>Challenges</h2>
			      	<p>For this lab, me and my lab partner worked together to create a Javascript function that would sort the loetters of our name into alphabetic order.</p>
			      <h2>Problems</h2>
				      <p>I struggled a bit with this lab, due to my limited knowledge of the Javascript language. With the help of my partner and my browser console, I was able to debug my code and create an effective function.</p>
			      <h2>Results</h2>
				      <p>The results of this lab is the page you are looking at now!</p>
