        <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>For this lab, we were tasked with experimenting with loops within Javascript to calculate multiples and label numbers.
        <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>Me and my partner did not run into any significant problems in the process of this lab. For the most part everything went smoothly, and all issues were smoothed out in the debugging process!
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>The results of this lab are here, that which your eyeballs are grazing upon in this very moment.</p>
