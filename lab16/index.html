          <h1>Lab 16: JSON & APIs</h1>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>This lab asked us to experiment with JSON processing from an API.</p>
          <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I had a bit of difficulty getting down the Javascript syntax, and had to reorganize my HTML and Javascript files multiple times. I also wasn't understanding the concept of JSON in relationship to API, and I was inputting incorrect links into my ajax function.</p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The results of this lab are a simple yet existential comic for your viewing pleasure. Why are we all here, anyways?
