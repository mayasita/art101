			      <h2>Challenges</h2>
			      	<p>Me and my partner created specific functions in Javascript to receive callbacks with results.</p>
			      <h2>Problems</h2>
				      <p>I found this Lab to be a bit difficult, and had trouble implementing my Javascript into my html page, but overall the Lab was a success!</p>
			      <h2>Results</h2>
				      <p>The results of this lab is the page you are looking at now!</p>
